## Why Nexus exists

There was a time when the internet belonged to its inhabitants.

You installed TeamSpeak on an old PC, opened a phpBB forum on a 
Sunday afternoon, shared files via FTP without asking anyone's 
permission. Communities were born freely, lived on their own servers, 
died if they chose to. Nobody owned their content. Nobody could shut 
them down.

Then came the centralized platforms. Discord, Facebook, Slack. 
They said: *"It's simpler with us."* And it was true. So people followed.

The price? Invisible at first. Then heavier and heavier.

**Nexus was born to fix that.**

## Core Principles

1. **Privacy by architecture, not by promise**
2. **Indexable content as a right, not a privilege**
3. **Self-hosting as fundamental freedom**
4. **Total open source transparency**
5. **The Core is sacred — nobody touches it**
6. **Modularity as respect for contributors**
7. **Humans before technology**

## Survival Clause

If Nexus ever betrays these principles, this manifesto explicitly 
authorizes any community member to fork the project and continue 
it in the spirit of this manifesto.

**Nexus belongs to its community. Not its creators.**
